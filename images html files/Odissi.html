	<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family:cursive ;"><b>Odissi Dance</b>
Odissi is a classical Indian dance form originating from the state of Odisha. It is characterized by its graceful and intricate movements that reflect the rich cultural heritage of the region. With origins dating back to ancient temples, Odissi combines storytelling, spirituality, and rhythmic expression. Dancers use fluid body movements, hand gestures (mudras), and facial expressions to convey narratives from mythology and literature. The dance emphasizes the tribhangi posture, where the body forms three bends, lending it a sculptural quality. Accompanied by traditional music and intricate footwork, Odissi is a captivating art form that embodies tradition and artistic elegance.</p><br>

<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family:cursive ;"><img class="left_side"  src="images/odissi_styles.jpg"><b>Origin and History</b><br>
Odissi's roots can be traced back to the temples of Odisha, where it was initially performed as a sacred ritual dance dedicated to various deities. The history of Odissi can be divided into several periods. It underwent a transformation during the medieval era when it was suppressed by various rulers, leading to its preservation in secretive environments like the Gotipuas, young male dancers who disguised themselves as females to keep the tradition alive. After India's independence, Odissi experienced a revival, thanks to the efforts of dance gurus and artists who worked to restore its original glory.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family:cursive ;"><b>Evolution and Styles</b><br>
	Over the centuries, Odissi has evolved, incorporating different styles and influences. While the Gotipuas played a crucial role in preserving the dance form, it also led to a distinctive "Mahari" style, characterized by fluid movements and devotion. Another style emerged from royal courts, known as the "Nartaki" style, which incorporated intricate footwork and graceful poses. These styles merged into what we recognize today as classical Odissi, which strikes a balance between the two.<br></p><br><br>
